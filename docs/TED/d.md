I wanted to be a **psychologist** since I was a teenager, and I spent years pursuing
that one goal.I opened my private practice as soon as I was licensed. It was a
risky move, not getting a day job at a hospital or a clinic, but within one year, my
practice was doing quite well and I was making more money thanl ever made be-
fore. Of course, I was a full-time student my entire life.

I could have worked at McDonald's and made more money than I ever made be-
fore.

That one-year mark came on a Friday night in July.I walked home to my apartment and got into the elevator with a neighbor who was a doctor in the ER. The elevator rose, then it **shuddered and stalled between floors.** And the man who dealt with emergencies for a living began poking at the buttons and banging on the door,saying, "This is my nightmare, this is my nightmare!" And I was like, "And this is my nightmare.'

I felt terrible afterwards, though. Because I wasn't panicked and I knew what to say to calm him down.I was just **too depleted to do it,** I had nothing left to give, and that confused me. After all, I was finally living my dream, so why wasn't I happy? Why did I feel so **burned out?**

For a few terrible weeks, I questioned whether I'd made a mistake. What if I had
chosen the wrong profession? What if I had spent my entire life pursuing the
wrong career? But then I realized, no, I still loved psychology. The problem wasn't the work I did in my office. It was the hours I spent **ruminating about** work when I was home. I closed the door to my office every night, but the door in my head remained wide-open and the stress just **flooded in.**

That's the interesting thing about work stress. We don't really experience much of it at work. We're too busy. We experience it outside of work, when we are **commuting,** when we're home, when we're trying to **rejuvenate.** It is important to recover in our spare time, to de-stress and do things we enjoy, and the biggest **obstruction we face in that regard is ruminating.** Because each time we do it, we're actually activating our stress response.

Now, to ruminate means to chew over. The word **refers to** how cows digest their
food. For those of you **unfamiliar with** the joys of cow digestion, cows chew, then they **swallow,** then they **regurgitate** it back up and chew it again.

It does not work for humans. Because what we chew over are the upsetting things, the **distressing things,** and we do it in ways that are entirely unproductive. lt's the hours we spend **obsessing about** tasks we didn't complete or stewing about **tensions with a colleague,** or **anxiously worrying about the future,** or **second-guessing decisions** we've made.
