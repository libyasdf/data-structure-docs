I wanted to be a **psychologist** since I was a teenager, and I spent years pursuing
that one goal.I opened my private practice as soon as I was licensed. It was a
risky move, not getting a day job at a hospital or a clinic, but within one year, my
practice was doing quite well and I was making more money thanl ever made be-
fore. Of course, I was a full-time student my entire life.

I could have worked at McDonald's and made more money than I ever made be-
fore.

That one-year mark came on a Friday night in July.I walked home to my apartment and got into the elevator with a neighbor who was a doctor in the ER. The elevator rose, then it **shuddered and stalled between floors.** And the man who dealt with emergencies for a living began poking at the buttons and banging on the door,saying, "This is my nightmare, this is my nightmare!" And I was like, "And this is my nightmare.'

I felt terrible afterwards, though. Because I wasn't panicked and I knew what to say to calm him down.I was just **too depleted to do it,** I had nothing left to give, and that confused me. After all, I was finally living my dream, so why wasn't I happy? Why did I feel so **burned out?**

For a few terrible weeks, I questioned whether I'd made a mistake. What if I had
chosen the wrong profession? What if I had spent my entire life pursuing the
wrong career? But then I realized, no, I still loved psychology. The problem wasn't the work I did in my office. It was the hours I spent **ruminating about** work when I was home. I closed the door to my office every night, but the door in my head remained wide-open and the stress just **flooded in.**

That's the interesting thing about work stress. We don't really experience much of it at work. We're too busy. We **experience** it outside of work, when we are **commuting,** when we're home, when we're trying to **rejuvenate.** It is important to recover in our spare time, to de-stress and do things we enjoy, and the biggest **obstruction we face in that regard is ruminating.** Because each time we do it, we're actually activating our stress response.

Now, to ruminate means to chew over. The word **refers to** how cows digest their food. For those of you **unfamiliar with** the joys of cow digestion, cows chew, then they **swallow,** then they **regurgitate** it back up and chew it again.

It does not work for humans. Because what we chew over are the upsetting things, the **distressing things,** and we do it in ways that are entirely unproductive. lt's the hours we spend **obsessing about** tasks we didn't complete or stewing about **tensions with a colleague,** or **anxiously worrying about the future,** or **second-guessing decisions** we've made.

Now there's a lot of research on how we think about work when we are not at
work, and the findings are quite **alarming.** Ruminating about work, replaying the same thoughts and worries over and over again,**significantly disrupts** our ability to recover and **recharge** in the off hours. The more we ruminate about work when we're home, the more likely we are to experience sleep **disturbances,** to eat unhealthier foods and to have worse moods. It may even increase our risk of cardiovascular disease and of impairing
our executive functioning, the very skill sets we need to do our jobs well. Not to mention the toll it takes on our relationships and family lives, because people around us can tell we're checked out and preoccupied.

Now, those same studies found that while ruminating about work when we're
home damages our emotional well-being, thinking about work in creative or prob-
lem-solving ways does not. Because those kinds of thinking do not elicit emotional
distress and, more importantly, they're in our control. We can decide whether to re-
spond to an email or leave it till morning, or whether we want to brainstorm about
work
projects
that
excite
us.
But
ruminations
are
involuntary. They're
intrusive. They pop into our head when we don't want them to. They upset us
when we don't want to be upset. They switch us on when we are trying to switch
off. And they are very difficult to resist, because thinking of all our unfinished tasks
feels urgent. Anxiously worrying about the future feels compelling. Ruminating al-
ways feels like we're doing something important, when in fact, we're doing some-
thing harmful. And we all do it far more than we realize.

And 90 minutes during a friend's "talent show" that, coincidentally, was 90 minutes
long.
还有在朋友的“才艺表演秀”中的90分钟，这个表演秀恰好也就90分钟。

In total, that week, it was almost 14 hours. That's how much "downtime" I was los-
ing to something that actually increased my stress. Try keeping a journal for one
week. See how much you do it.

That's what made me realize that I still loved my work. But ruminating was destroy-
ing that love and it was destroying my personal life, too. So I read every study I
could find, and I went to war against my ruminations. Now, habit change is hard. It
took real diligence to catch myself ruminating each time, and real consistency to
make the new habits stick. But eventually, they did. I won my war against ruminat-
ing, and I'm here to tell you how you can win yours.
那让我意识到，我仍然热爱我的工作。 但是反刍思考摧毁了我的热爱，同时也摧
毁了我的个人生活。于 是我如饥似渴地阅读了所有相关论文，并开始和我的反刍 .
思考做斗争。改变习惯是很困难的。我只能异常刻苦，才能在每次反刍思考时克
制自己，并且异常坚持，才能让新习惯得以养成。但最终，我成功了。我战胜了
我的反刍思考习惯，而今天我在这里， 想要告诉大家如何赢得你自己的战斗。

First, you need clear guardrails. You have to define when you switch off every
night, when you stop working. And you have to be strict about it. The rule I made
to myself at the time was that I was done at 8pm. And I forced myself to stick to
it. Now people say to me, "Really? You didn't return a single email after 8pm? You
didn't even look at your phone?" No, not once. Because it was the '90s, we didn't
have smartphones.

| got my first smartphone in 2007. You know, the iPhone had just come out, and |
wanted a phone that was cool and hip. I got a BlackBerry.
我在2007年买了第一台智能手机。那时iPhone刚问世，我想要一 台 又酷又时髦
的手机。我买了一 台黑莓。

I was excited, though, you know, my first thought was, "I get my emails wherever |
am." And 24 hours later, I was like, "I get my emails wherever | am."
不过我很兴奋，我第一个想法是，“我 随时随地都能收邮件了。”24个小时之
后，我就开始变得沮丧了。

I mean, battling ruminations was
hard
enough when they just invaded our
thoughts. But now they have this Trojan horse, our phones, to hide within. And
each time we just look at our phone after hours, we can be reminded of work and
ruminative thoughts can slip out and slaughter our evening or weekend. So, when
you switch off, switch off your email notifications. And if you have to check them,
decide on when to do it, SO it doesn't interfere with your plans, and do it only then.

Cell phones aren't the only way technology is empowering rumination, because we
have an even bigger fight coming. Telecommuting has increased 115 percent over
the past decade. And it's expected to increase even more dramatically going for-
ward. More and more of US are losing our
physical boundary between work and
home. And that means that reminders of work will be able to trigger ruminations
from anywhere in our home. When we lack a physical boundary between work and
home, we have to create a psychological one. We have to trick our mind into defin-
ing work and nonwork times and spaces. So here's how you do that.

First, create a defined work zone in your home, even if it's tiny, and try to work only
there. Try not to work on the living room couch or on the bed because really, those
areas should be associated with living and .. bedding.

Next, when you're working from home, wear clothes you only wear when you're
working. And then at the end of the day, change clothes, and use music and light-
ing to shift the atmosphere from work to home. Make it a ritual. Now, some of you
might think that's silly. That changing clothes and lighting will convince my mind I'm
no longer at work. Trust me, your mind will fall for it. Because we are really smart,
our mind is really stupid.

It falls for random associations all the time, right? | mean, that's why Pavlov's dog
began drooling at the sound of a bell. And why TED speakers begin sweating at
the sight of a red circle.
它整天掉进各种关联的圈套，不是吗?这就是为什么巴甫洛夫的狗在听到铃声时会
开始流口水，以及为什么 TED演讲者在看到红色圆圈时会开始出汗。

Now those things will help, but ruminations will still invade. And when they do, you
have to convert them into productive forms of thinking, like problem-solving.

My patient Sally is a good example. Sally was given the promotion of a
lifetime, but it came with a price. She was no
longer able to pick up
her
daughter from school every day, and that broke her heart. So she came up with a
plan. Every Tuesday and Thursday, Sally left work early, picked up her daughter
from school, played with her, fed her, bathed her and put her to bed. And then she
went back to the office and worked past midnight to catch up. Only, Sally's rumina-
tion journal indicated she spent almost every minute of her quality time with her
daughter ruminating about how much work she had to do.

Ruminations often deny us our most precious moments. Sally's rumination, "I have
SO much work to do," is a very common one. And like all of them, it's useless and
it's harmful, because we'd never think it when we're at work, getting stuff done. We
think it when we're outside of work, when we're trying to relax or do things that we
find meaningful, like playing with our children, or having a date night with our part-
ner. 

To convert a ruminative thought into a productive one, you have to pose it as a
problem to be solved. The problem-solving version of "I have SO much work to
do" is a scheduling question. Like, "Where in my schedule can I fit the tasks that
are troubling me?" Or, "What canl move in my schedule to make room for this
more urgent thing?" Or even, "When do I have 15 minutes to go over my
schedule?" All those are problems that can be solved. "I have SO much work to do"
is not.

Battling rumination is hard, but if you stick to your guardrails, if you ritualize the
transition from work to home, and if you train yourself to convert ruminations into
productive forms of thinking, you will succeed. Banishing ruminations truly
en-
hanced my personal life, but what it enhanced even more was the joy and satisfac-
tion I get from my work.

Ground zero for creating a healthy work-life balance is not in the real world. It's in
our head. It's with ruminating. If you want to reduce your stress and improve your
quality of life, you don't necessarily have to change your hours or your job. You just
have to change how you think.
